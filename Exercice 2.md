I would make an effort to remember the most recent occasions when we had been traveling together while thinking about the famous or noteworthy places we had passed by. This might make it easier for me estimate the distance between our current positions. Since there is no information available about which direction my friend's car might be, I would make an initial decision to drive in one direction, let's say I choose to go forward, After driving the initial distance, i would stop the car and carefully observe the surroundings, i would look for any signs of a broken-down car, if I don't see any signs of my friend's car or any other helpful information, I would conclude that I haven't gone in the right direction, in this case, I would turn back and start driving in the opposite direction.
